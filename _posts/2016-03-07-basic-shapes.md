The shapes one decides to use in a design has a tremendous effect on the overall feeling of the piece. To explore this idea, it can be helpful to focus on just a few basic shapes, and try to understand how their characteristics can be used to accomplish your goal.

Rect - Triangle - Ellipse

Like many other things, the ability to create symbolism from shapes is a skill that needs to be practiced for it to be developed. Constraining yourself to just these simple shapes makes sense in the same way that it does for a chess player to practice openings. You develop a solid foundation upon which to build a game.

Take a look at the two illustrations below. It doesn't require much effort to see that the one on the left looks the most like an ice cream cone. We can objectively say that it's the best design.

nice ice cream cone - bad ice cream cone

This is one of the first assignments I give my design students: Design an ice cream cone in black and white using only `rect()`, `triangle()` and `ellipse()` once in your code.

After seeing hundreds of solutions to this simple assignment, there seems to be an infinite number of ways to solve this design problem. However, they tend to fit into a few categories.

There's an iconic category with designs that illustrate the pure, iconic form of the cone. This is often done by using properly proportioned shapes and aligning them at the center of the canvas.

MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS CATEGORY

ADD REALISTIC CATEGORY. DESIGNS THAT LOOK LIKE A DRAWING.

There's an abstract category with designs, often done by more trained designers, who choose a more playful approach. These designs are often more subjective, because the individual style of each designer start to emerge.

ABSTRACT EXAMPLES

Even though this is a very simple assignment, many students explore the possibilities of the medium, using `for` loops to create designs that are uniquely computational. (something about "interesting", and links to repetition and randomization).

LUISA, OTHER EXAMPLES OF DESIGN SYSTEM.


In all of the categories above, our [basic variables](#) are used to solve the assignment in some way or another, using the characteristics of the basic shapes. Even though this exercise seems pretty xxxx from the work real designers do, many successful designs were created solely by choosing the right shapes for the content.

Paul rand knife sharp - cheese round - other a logo?

Something about the exercise, "design a word"

balance - sharp, etc... Same words as first article

... it's a worthwhile things to practice before moving on to more complex systems.
