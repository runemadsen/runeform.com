As you're starting your journey into the field of graphic design, it's wise to start at the very beginning. Graphic design is the art of manipulating form and color to successfully convey a particular message. This is done by building visual relationships between the shapes you use, and keep iterating until those clearly communicate what you're trying to say.

The most basic of these relationships is the one between the canvas and the shapes within it. It's possible to create a range of different expressions by changing a few variables of a single shape within the canvas. In the following, we will use the **position**, **size** and **rotation** of a
single rectangle to investigate the qualities of this simple relationship.

By changing the **size** of a shape, we can communicate whether that shape is important or not.

<div class="two-grid">
  {% include svg.html src="canvas-and-shape/dominant.svg" caption="A dominant rectangle." %}
  {% include svg.html src="canvas-and-shape/non-dominant.svg" caption="A non-dominant rectangle." %}
</div>

By changing the **position** and **rotation** of the rectangle, we can make it seem either static or dynamic. Furthermore, we can use its placement in relation to the canvas to direct the eye towards interesting visual clues.

<div class="two-grid">
  {% include svg.html src="canvas-and-shape/balance.svg" caption="A balancing rectangle." %}
  {% include svg.html src="canvas-and-shape/lean.svg" caption="A leaning rectangle." %}
</div>

By working with these basic variables, we can create a range of expressions, and it's a good habit to keep these in mind as you add more techniques to your visual vocabulary. It's also beneficial to consider using a vertical or square canvas, as the dimensions of the canvas itself has a big effect on the design.
