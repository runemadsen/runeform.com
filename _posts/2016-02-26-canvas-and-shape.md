As we begin our journey into the field of graphic design, it's important to start at the very beginning. Graphic design is the art of manipulating form and color to successfully convey a message. The design process is one of trial and error, and it often takes a lot of iteration to create a design that clearly communicates what you're trying to say.

One can argue that the first step to becoming a better designer involves learning how to see. You can practice this by starting with a simple exercise: Making a design for a word. This allows you to become comfortable with some basic design techniques, and this is exactly where we'll start: By looking at the most basic relationship in graphic design, the relationship between a single shape and the canvas, and using three simple variables, the **position**, **size**, and **rotation** of a rectangle, to create designs for different words.

## Size

When you start drawing shapes in a blank canvas, one of the first considerations to make, is what size your shapes should be. Size matters because it effectively communicates whether a shape is important or not.

A shape will appear dominant if it takes up most of the canvas. We recognize this pattern from many design products that we encounter daily: Traffic signs have the word *STOP* taking up most of the area of the sign. Dialog boxes block out most of the text of a website to leave you with a single or binary option. It is a natural way to call attention to the shape.

THIS NEEDS CODE:

<div class="two-grid">
  {% include img.html src="canvas-and-shape/dominant.svg" caption="A dominant rectangle." datauri="true" %}
  {% include img.html src="canvas-and-shape/non-dominant.svg" caption="A non-dominant rectangle." datauri="true" %}
</div>

The size of a shape can therefore be used to bring clarity to a design, by increasing the size of important shapes and decreasing the size of less important shapes. It can often help to draw black boxes on top of actual designs to reveal this relationship, and doing it on work by famous designers will reveal how this is an integral part of most design processes.

## Position

Another important relationship is the positioning of shapes in the canvas. Most languages have a natural reading direction (english is left to right, arabic right to left) that can be used to prioritize the importance of shapes. Proper use of positioning simply gives the reader a clue about where to start.

This pattern is used throughout the design world to create, in lack of a better word, rhythm. Graphic novels use the positioning of captions to guide the reader through the storyline. Newspapers place the most important text in a heading at the top of an article, which also tends to have a larger size to set it apart.

When you change the position of a shape, you also change the empty space between the shapes. This concept, often called whitespace, is another thing to notize. In example X2, there is an equal amount of whitespace on the sides of the rectangle. This creates symmetry and balance, which is broken in example X3 where the square moves off center.

{% include img.html src="test.svg" caption="In his famous ads for Volkswagen, William Bernbach used the position and size of the car to convey the message of the text." class="media-width" %}

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

## Rotation

A third important relationship relates to the rotation of shapes. Rotation can be used to make shapes come alive, as the whitespace around them becomes more complex and breaks the symmetry of the design.

DORMANT

DYNAMIC

We define rotation as a degree between 0 and 360 (often converted to radians that go between 0 and 2PI), and there is a natural relationship between the amount of rotation a shape has, and how complex a whitespace it produces. A rectangle with internal angles at 90 degrees will seem most dynamic with a rotation that is not a division of 90.

45 degrees, 90 degrees, 27 degrees

Rotation is used in many types of design products: Children's books use rotated shapes to make them look fun and playful. Popular magazines use rotated grid systems to make the content look less dry, while publications for a narrow target audience use horizontal grid systems to imply quality of the content within.

{% include img.html src="test.svg" caption="Paul Rand uses squares with different rotations to make a playful cover for a children's book." class="media-width" %}

{% include img.html src="test.svg" caption="The Adidas logo consists of three rectangles offset to look like a podium. Rotation is used to make the logo dynamic." class="media-width" %}


## Combining the three

These variables are all proportional to the dimensions of the canvas, so if you make the canvas bigger, the shapes should be bigger too. This would take a lot of manual work in a program like Illustrator, but in code we can use the width and height of the canvas to automatically calculate the position of our shapes.

The following two lines of code have identical outcomes, but the latter will place the rectangle in the bottom right corner, no matter the canvas size. The former will not.

{% include code_static.html caption="Do not use hardcoded numbers." class="media-width dont" code="rect(900, 900, 100, 100);" %}

{% include code_static.html caption="Do use width and height to calculate position." class="media-width do" code="rect(width - 100, height - 100, 100, 100);" %}

By constraining yourself to just a rectangle and these three variables, you will train one of the most fundamental skills in design: Seeing visual relationships. The following examples of designs for a single word will give you some idea of what the result might look like.

SHOW WORD/DESIGN GRID

Although this is just our first step into the world of graphic design, many extra-ordinary works of art have been created using this approach.

GRAPHIC DESIGN EXAMPLES

It's common to find problems in existing designs that can be traced back to the use of position, size, and rotation. Whether it's a user interface that fails to emphasize an important button, or a graph with ambiguity around its underlying dataset, it's clear that some designers rush to make things pretty without thinking about these basic relationships. This should be seen as a failure of design, and one is much better off including these ideas as a vital part of any design process.
